For the new academic year I'm switching over to a new site based on the amazing
[Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) by
[George Cushen](https://twitter.com/georgecushen). Support for LaTeX,
[reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) slides (which I've used for my talks for
a few years now) and even [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks is all there
out of the box. I gave my [first talk]({{< ref "/talk/unitary-circuits-kings.md" >}})
from slides built this way last week at KCL. It's all working great so far!
