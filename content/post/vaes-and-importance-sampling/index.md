## Importance Sampling

We have a function $\phi(X)$ of a random variable $X$ and want to evaluate the expectation
$$
\E_{x\sim p}\left[\phi(x)\right].
$$

We can always trade the distribution $p$ for another distribution $q$ and write
$$
\E_{x\sim p}\left[\phi(x)\right] = \E_{x\sim q}\left[\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\phi(x)\right].
$$


It may be that the function $\phi$ doesnâ€™t lend itself to being averaged, perhaps because it has support on the tails of the distribution. Alternatively, it may be hard to draw samples from $p$.
