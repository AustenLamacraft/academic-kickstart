# New Rules:
## Quantum Circuits, Cellular Automata, Complexity and Chaos
[austen.uk/slides/new-rules](austen.uk/slides/new-rules)

Austen Lamacraft, University of Cambridge 


---

## Life

---

## Cellular Automata

A particularly simple kind of dynamical system where space, time, and the local variables are *all discrete*

---

## Quantum Circuits

Basis of quantum supremacy work by Google and others



---

## This talk

- What are the similarities and differences?
- What can we learn about dynamics more generally?
- Is it any use?

---

## General definition


---

## Rules 

How to classify?

---

## Cambridge station

[Discussed here](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2017/06/oh-my-gosh-its-covered-in-rule-30s/)

---

Wolfram's A New Kind of Science is 20 years old

---

## Multidomain automata

---

## Chaos

Notion of Hamming distance

---

## Causality

Notion of finite speed of light

---

## Damage spreading



---

## Applications

Hashing, cryptography

## Self-dual models

---

## Quantum circuits

In some way an analog of (block) CA

---

## Google Quantum Supremacy

---

## Tensor Networks

---

## Curved space?

Higher dimensions, AdS, etc.

---

## Unitarity

---

## Dual unitarity

---

## Horizon effect

Entanglement velocity and quasiparticle picture

---

## Maximal entanglement velocity implies dual unitarity

---

Measurements
