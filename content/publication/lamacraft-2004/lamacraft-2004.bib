 abstract = {When subject to a pair-breaking perturbation, the pairing susceptibility of a disordered superconductor exhibits substantial long-ranged mesoscopic fluctuations. Focusing on a thin film subject to a parallel magnetic field, it is proposed that the quantum phase transition to the bulk superconducting condensate may be pre-empted by the formation of a glass-like phase with multi-fractal correlations of a complex order parameter. Although not universal, we argue that such behaviour may be a common feature of quantum critical phenomena in disordered environments.},
