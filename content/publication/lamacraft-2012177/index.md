abstract: "Abstract This chapter seeks to outline a few basic problems in quantum\
  \ statistical physics, where recent experimental advances from the atomic physics\
  \ community offer the hope of dramatic progress. The focus is on nonequilibrium\
  \ situations, where the powerful concepts and methods of equilibrium statistical\
  \ physics and 창\x80\x9Clinear response창\x80\x9D theory (for small deviations from\
  \ equilibrium) are not applicable. The problems discussed here are chosen in part\
  \ because they have a high degree of 창\x80\x9Cuniversality창\x80\x9D or generality\
  \ across different microscopic situations, as the major challenge in nonequilibrium\
  \ statistical physics, both quantum and classical, has been to find principles as\
  \ general as the basic principles of equilibrium statistical physics or linear response."
