abstract: The Schrödinger bridge problem (SBP) finds the most likely stochastic evolution
  between two probability distributions given a prior stochastic evolution. As well
  as applications in the natural sciences, problems of this kind have important applications
  in machine learning such as dataset alignment and hypothesis testing. Whilst the
  theory behind this problem is relatively mature, scalable numerical recipes to estimate
  the Schrödinger bridge remain an active area of research. Our main contribution
  is the proof of equivalence between solving the SBP and an autoregressive maximum
  likelihood estimation objective. This formulation circumvents many of the challenges
  of density estimation and enables direct application of successful machine learning
  techniques. We propose a numerical procedure to estimate SBPs using Gaussian process
  and demonstrate the practical usage of our approach in numerical simulations and
  experiments.
